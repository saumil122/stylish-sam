# Stylish Sam - Dashboard System
The Dashboard System/Admin Panel is based on Bootstrap 4, Javascript, jQuery, SCSS, bootstrap-notify.js & chart.js.
   
# Benefits:

- Currently there are four different color variation.(i.e. style-01.css, style-02.css, style-03.css & style-04.css)
- All bootstrap components are supported.
- The responsive version needs to be check in actual device (Check & update in next release.)
- I have uploaded compiled HTML files here. Actually I built this admin panel in PHP (on my local system).
